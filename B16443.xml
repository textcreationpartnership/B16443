         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Wherby you may see the causes, why after<note place="margin">VVhy this Treatise is written.</note> so manie excellent Bookes, written in our language, for clearing al pointes of Christian Doctrine, this also is written in an other forme; prouing the same by holie Scriptures only. Which thing is vndertaken (as also the Holie Bible is for the same reasons, set forth in vulgar tongues) first to satisfie al such, as vntruly<note place="margin">The first cause.</note> suppose that we preferre anie other auctoritie aboue the holie Scriptures. Secondly to ioyne issue of trial <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with our Aduersaries, who imagine that herein they haue some aduantage against vs. And withal to geue contentment, if it be possible, to al those, which at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this time, wil admitte no other proofes in matter of Faith, and Religion, but the onlie Scriptures: that so it may appeare, who are best grounded therein.</p>
                  <p>For although our English Protestants in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">Protestants sometime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to stand to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers.</note> of Quene Elisabeths reigne, very boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked al Roman Catholiques to trie the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not only by the holie Scriptures; but also by the Ancient Councels, and Fathers of the first six hūdred yeares after Christ: as M. Iohn Iuel publikely<note place="margin">Anno 1559.</note> proclamed at S. Pauls Crosse in London; yet shortly after, finding by experience, that they were not able<note place="margin">Now they require onlie Scriptures.</note> to maintaine that chalenge, they generally euer since say plainly, that they wil not stand to anie other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie,

And holding opinion that the Church can erre in Faith, they endeuour to bring the very Church it self (theirs<note place="margin">Isa. 54. v. 17.</note> and our proper Iudge) to be iudged as a partie. Wherby they draw al Controuersies to this one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Who amongst al pretenders, righstly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the holie Scriptures? Wherupō we might most iustly require, that they by onlie Scriptures, should first disproue our long established Religion; and then also proue their owne, newly pretended.</p>

So when the children of Israel, had no other water to drinke in the deserte, but that which was bitter; [Moyses cried to our Lord (for<note place="margin">Exod. 15. v. 23. 24. 25.</note> remedie) &amp; he shewed him a peece of wood, which<note place="margin">A peece of wood.</note> when he had cast into the waters, they were turned into swetenesse] Againe God did the like to other vnprofitable water, by the vse of salt, which the<note place="margin">Salt.</note> Prophete [Eliseus cast into it, &amp; said: Thus saith our<note place="margin">4.

For [Isaac waxing old, called Esau his<note place="margin">Gen. 27. v. 1. 2. 3. 4.</note> elder sonne, &amp; said to him: Thou seest, quoth he, that I am old, and know not the day of my death.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:178362:11"/> an other secondarie blessing. The same Patriarch Iacob, blessed the two sonnes of his sonne Ioseph; &amp; that in special manner, crossing his armes, &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his right hand vpon the younger brother his head, &amp; his left hand vpon the head of the elder, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying literally that Ephraim the younger of those bretheren should be preferred before Manasses the elder, &amp; mystically signifying (which was likewise signified, by the blessing of Iacob before Esau) that the Gentiles should be preferred before the Iewes, in the Church of Christ: Insinuating also by crossing his armes the special vertue of the Crosse of Christ.

                     <p n="3">3. Generally in the written law of Moyses, God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:178362:11"/> signified his spiritual benefites, by manie Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial<note place="margin">External Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to keepe the people from Idolatrie To induce thē to internal vertues, &amp; to signifie grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mysteries in the new Testament.</note> ordinances, &amp; external Rites, which were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for three special causes: First to withdraw, &amp; kepe the people from Idolatrie, wherto they were very prone. Secondly to induce them therby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal vertues: for that by visible thinges, men enter into conceipte of inuisible. Thirdly to signifie, more excellent, and more effectual Mysteries of the new Testament. So when God had deliuered his tenue moral precepts, he gaue also ceremonial, saying: [An Altar of earth you shal make to me, &amp; you shal<note place="margin">Exod. 20. v. 24.</note> offer vpon it, your Holocaustes, &amp; Pacifiques, your sheepe, &amp; oxen, in euerie place, where the memorie of my name shal be, I wil come to thee, &amp; wil blesse thee. And if thou make an Altar of stone vnto me,<note place="margin">v. 25.</note> thou shalt not builde it of hewed stones: for if thou lift vp thy knife ouer it, it shal be polluted.] Where it is cleare that the vse of an Altar is to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice theron, of diuers sortes: as here is mention of two kindes: Holocaustes in which the whole hoste was burned &amp; consumed in the honour of God; &amp; Pacifiques, which were either of thankesgeuing for benefites receiued; or petitatorie for obtaining thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges needful. The third kind was Sacrifice for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Which being duly offered, was an external signe of Gods inuisible grace, remitting sinnes: as God himself testifieth saying: [I haue geuen the<note place="margin">Leuit. 17. v. 11.</note> bloud to you, that vpon the Altar you may make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation with it, for your soules, &amp; the bloud may be<note place="margin">It was forbid to eate bloud, because it was to be offered in sacrifice.</note> for an expiation of the soule] which was the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial reason, why the faithful seruants of God were so strictly prohibited, not to eate anie bloud, for so it foloweth in the next wordes, [therfore (said our Lord) haue I said to the children of Israel: No soule of you, shal eate bloud; nor of the strangers<note place="margin">And to make more hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therfore God strictly forbade, to offer anie other Sacrifice, or in anie other maner, then according to his owne institution. [What I command thee (said God to his chosen<note place="margin">Deut. 12. v. 32.</note>

We speake of al times since Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were first instituted.

[If anie of the soiorners (strangers) be willing to dwel among you, &amp; make the Phase of the Lord, first al the male that he hath, shal be circuncised, &amp; then shal he celebrate it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rites: &amp; he shal be as he that is borne in the land: but if there be anie man vncircuncised, he shal not eate therof.

Yea the holie Altar it self (as wel of other oblations, as of Incense) were sanctified by the Sacrifice, &amp; by reason of the Sacrifice, it sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the giftes, that were offered therupon.

And the continual abstinence from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meates legally vncleane, had particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the offering of Sacrifices, &amp; receiuing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. For neither anie thing reputed by the Law vncleane, could be offered in Sacrifice, nor anie persons being vncleane, could be partakers of Sacrifices, or Sacramēts, til they were first cleansed. So by the vse of al other holie Ceremonies it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that Sacrifice is the cheefest external seruice, &amp; worshipe of God. And that next to them are Sacramentes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Most true it is, that internal vertues, &amp; spiritual Sacrifices, are much more required, then external,<note place="margin">Internal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Sacrifice, as before the cheefest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal seruice of God.</note> as both reason teacheth, and holie Scriptures doe often testifie, perferring them expresly before exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sacrifice it self; which also confirmeth our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose. For that, when God by his Prophetes, &amp; by Christ our Lord, required true repentance of the hart, iustice in al actions, obedience, mercie, gratitude, with praises of God, &amp; the like vertues,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:178362:24"/> saying he wil rather haue them, then Sacrifice; he plainly shewed, that Sacrifice is the principal of al external diuine Seruice, &amp; rightly so estemed of the faithful. As when King Saul pretending excuse of his disobedience, in that he reserued the better thinges taken in praye, that the same might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in Sacrifice, the Prophete Samuel reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him said: [Why, wil our Lord haue Holocaustes<note place="margin">1.

For better is obedience then victimes, &amp; to hearken father, then to offer the facte of rāmes] In like manner God by his Prophete Osee, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished such people, as neglecting workes of mercie, thought to escape punishment, by offering Sacrifices, that it would not auail them: [Because<note place="margin">Osee. 6. v. 6.</note>

[Goe your wayes (saith hee) and<note place="margin">Mat. 9. v. 13.</note> learne, what it is: <hi>I wil mercie, &amp; not Sacrifice.</hi>] By which &amp; the like sayinges, external <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THus much touching al diuine Sacrifices, and Sacraments, especially of the old Testament. Now we are to declare others, of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; Christian Church. And first in General, that Christ our Sauiour hath instituted some holie Sacraments, al that wil seme to be Christians, doe confesse in wordes at least.

And withal in the proper place, that there is a proper propiciatorie, most excellent exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sacrifice in the Law of grace, the complement of al old, true, &amp; lawful Sacrifices, that were from the beginning of the world, before Christ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. First therefore it is proued both by figures, and prophecies of the old Testament, &amp; by testimonies of the new, that Christ instituted certaine holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that is to say, <hi>Visible signes of inuisible grace.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The definitiō of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> or as Protestants confesse, External Rites with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial promise of spiritual grace, &amp; remission of sinnes. For as the Tabernacle prefigured the Church of<note place="margin">Christs Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were prefigured by Sacraments &amp; other Rites of the old Testament.</note>
                        <note place="margin">Exo. 25. v. 8 &amp;c. Leuit. 1. v. 1. 3 &amp;c. Heb. 9. v. 9.</note> Christ, being as S. Paul calleth it [a parable of the time present] euen so the thinges done therin, by the Priestes of the same old Law, and by other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial obseruances [in meats, &amp; in drinckes, and diuers baptismes, &amp; iustices of the flesh] were figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of Christes, and his Priestes actions, and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Rites: the same Apostle teaching in the same place, that these thinges [were laid on them (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> to the Iewes) vntil the time of correction] not that al external Rites should be taken away, and al quite abolished, but changed, &amp; bettered. For so the next wordes doe plainly testifie, that the Law of grace, is not without other religions external actions. [But Christ (saith this Apostle) assisting<note place="margin">v. 11.</note> an Highpriest, of the good thinges to come, by a more ample, &amp; more perfect Tabernacle, not made

But as it was prefigured by the former old Sacrifices, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; other Rites of the old Testament: so is it represented by religious Rites, of the Christian Church, &amp; also applied in particular, to those faithful soules, which are from time to time actually iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and sanctified by the onlie merite of Christ,<note place="margin">1.

For vnles by applying, &amp; not applying of our Redemers ransome, the iust were distinguished from the wicked, and finally the elect from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; you should say: that seing Christ died for al, &amp; redemed al, so al shal be iustified, &amp; al saued. which is most false. For the farre greater part of<note place="margin">Mat. 7. v. 13.</note> men are wicked, and the farre greater number wil be eternally damned. And as this application of grace, was signified by Sacraments, &amp; Sacrifices, wherof the faithful in the old Testament, beleuing in Christ then to come were participant: so now the application of grace is also signified, by other grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better signes, [in a more ample, and more<note place="margin">Heb. 9. v. 11.

The same may also be exemplified in the figure of Circumcision, the Pascal lambe, Manna, the Loaues of proposition, ordinatiō of Priestes, &amp; Leuites, diuers sacrifices, with manie particular Rites, as the sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of bloud vpon the vpper stransom, &amp; cheekes of the doore of the houses, where the Paschal lambe was first immolated, whilest the Israelites were yet in Aegypt, the sprinkling of bloud of the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <p n="2">2. Touching the first point; the principal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwen the Sacraments of the old and new<note place="margin">Sacraments of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did only signifie grace.

The reason of which difference is because al vertue of Sacraments procedeth from the merite of Christ, in whom the faithful of the old Testament beleued, as being to come, and by his Passion to redeme mankinde, and to merite this grace; which merite being not extant, could not be applied by anie instrumental cause, but only be a signe without<note place="margin">Psal. 39. v. 7. 8.

An other difference is, that<note place="margin">Artic. 8.</note>

And that in the meane time the schismatical Samaritans,<note place="margin">v. 22.</note> adored that they knew not; but the Iewes adored that which they knew, he signifyed, that the Iewes offered sacrifice, &amp; adored lawfully, &amp; the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes vnlawfully [for saluation (said he) is of the<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Iewes] he then added that there should be adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (by offering Sacrifice) in other places; and in other maner; not in the flesh, and bloud of lambes, calues, &amp; other terrene creatures, not hauing in them veritie, grace, spirite, &amp; life; and therfore such sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices should be taken away, and an other Sacrifice should succede, which should be in it self, celestial &amp; diuine, ful of veritie, grace, spirite, &amp; life; which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice therfore is the veritie it self, wherof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were figures. And this is called [spirite &amp; veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Ch. 4. v. 23. Ch. 1. v. 17.</note> grace &amp; veritie] in respect of the other sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were indede true sacrifices, yet but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of Christs bodie and bloud, sacrificed once on the Crosse, nere to Ierusalem, &amp; dayly in al nations:<note place="margin">Mal. 1. v. 11. Luc. 22. v. 19. 1. Cor. 11. v. 26.</note> as Malachias prophecied; and our Lord instituted, &amp;<note place="margin">Largely taken al Sacraments and al diuine Seruice are adoration.</note> commanded to be done, vntil he come againe in the end of the world. Adoration also more largely signifieth, al whorshipe of God, not only by Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but by al Sacraments of the new Testament: and so they likewise are veritie, grace, and spirite, both signifying &amp; geuing grace, which the old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments<note place="margin">Christian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are external signes &amp; true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grace.</note> did only signifie but not geue. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christian Baptisme is water and the Holie Ghost. Confirmation is holie Chrisme, &amp; the Holie Ghost. The Eucharist is the formes of bread &amp; wine, and Christs very bodie and bloud: the true bread of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:178362:29"/> life; And so the other Sacraments are external sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; true sanctifying grace. Because Christ hath so merited, and so instituted, that they should worke effectually, that which they signifie [the wordes<note place="margin">Iob. 6. v. 63.</note> that I haue spoken to you be spirite &amp; life] said he to his Disciples. And S. Peter in the name of them al said againe to him.

                     <p n="3">3. Likewise S.

[If that which is made voide<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> (saith he) is by glorie, that which abideth is in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.] Vpon the like occasion of false Apostles, he also sheweth the excellencie of Christian Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

For euen as properly,<note place="margin">A similitude.</note> and truly as it is said; that a man writeth, his hand writeth; &amp; his penne writeth; and that a Scribe, or Secretarie writeth the wil of an other, so no lesse true and proper is it to say: God geueth grace, and remission of sinnes, as the principal Agent; Christ as Man, doth the same, as Gods instrument vnited in Diuine Person. The Sacraments doe the same, as instruments prepared to such vse: &amp; Christs Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters doe also the same, as his deputies. Through his merite, and power, inuisibly working by the same instruments, &amp; ministerie.

Amongst other senses of the Psalmists wordes saying to God [Thou hast<note place="margin">Psal. 22. v. 5.</note> fatted my head with oyle] it semeth most probable that he vttered them in the person of faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, rendering thankes to God, for benefites by this external signe in the forehead, receiued by the vse of diuers Sacraments, which are conduites of grace: more especially by that Sacrament, in which the forehead is signed, and annointed with holie Chrisme, made of oyle &amp; balme. For albeit Sacred oyle is also vsed in the Rites of Baptisme, in the ordination of Priestes, and Bishopes: in Extreme vnction, &amp; in the vnction of some Christian Kinges, likewise in cōsecration of holie Altares, &amp; Chalices: Yet this particular mention [of fatting the head with oyle] may be most properly applied to the grace, geuen to euerie Christian after Baptisme, that he may not feare, nor be ashamed to confesse Christs true Religion.

Moreouer as it is manifest, that the Apostles with others, receiued this promised special grace of the Holie Ghost, by other visible signes, of a vehement winde, &amp; of parted tongues, as it were of fire, sitting<note place="margin">That special grace which was geuen to the faithful on whit sunday by other visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signes, was also geuē to others by imposition of Apostolical handes after Baptisme.</note> vpon euerie one of them: which God then wrought extraordinarily without a Sacrament: so it is no lesse euident, that S. Peter affirmed to al, which would be baptized, for remission of their sinnes, that they should also receiue the gift of the Holie Ghost: &amp; likewise that he, and other Apostles did impose their handes vpon the baptized, for this very purpose, &amp; effect, that they might receiue the same gift of the Holie Ghost, a new grace, &amp; distinct spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefite after Baptisme. S.

Peter, and S. Iohn: to witte, that by their prayer, and imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of handes, the Holie Ghost might be powred vpon them, &amp; geuen to them againe after Baptisme? The very same thing which the Catholique Church beleueth, &amp; teacheth, that they which are baptized, doe by Confirmation receiue the Holie Ghost, with increase of special new grace. Againe we haue in this same Historie of the Actes of the Apostles, how<note place="margin">S. Paul also administred Confirmation to those that were already baptized.</note> [S. Paul coming to Ephesus, and finding certaine<note place="margin">Ch. 19. v. 1. 2. 3.</note> disciples, that were only baptized in S. Iohns Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, caused them to be baptized with Christs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. And then himself imposed handes on them,<note place="margin">v. 5. 6.</note> and the Holie Ghost came vpon them.] Here you see three distinct holie Rites. First [these men were already baptized in S. Iohns Baptisme (which was no Sacrament) Secondly [they were baptized in<note place="margin">5.</note> the name of our Lord Iesus (which is the first Christian Sacrament) Thirdly [S.

                     <p n="8">8. But if anie wil obiect, that because these visible

For answer touching practise, we first aske them, why Protestants make resemblance to practise it? Secondly touching both the efficacie, &amp; practise, they may as wel say, that because the visible miracles, which our Sauiour promised [should folow them<note place="margin">Mar. 16. v. 17. 18.</note> that beleued &amp; were baptized] doe not now folow, therfore none doe now beleue.

Finally therfore<note place="margin">An other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> we answer, as wel in respect of beleefe, &amp; Baptisme, as of Confirmation; that visible miraculous signes are wrought of God rather [for Infidels, then for the faithful] as S.

But when, &amp; where it is once receiued, and firmely fixed in the hartes of the faithful, such miracles commonly cease. As when greue plantes are first sette, they nede watering, but not after that they haue taken fast roote in the earth: euen so the visible miracles ceasing, the inuisible grace, the principal &amp; most proper effect of Sacraments, remaineth annexed vnto them. And so notwithstanding miracles are now more rare in the Christian world, yet there be (God be therfore glorified) innumerable persons of al sortes and degrees, which rightly beleue in Iesus Christ, &amp; the inuisible gracious effectes doe vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly folow the due administration, and worthie receiuing of Baptisme, &amp; Confirmation.

For more cleare notifying the state of this controuersed question, it is first to be obserued, that al which wil seme to beare the name of Christians, doe acknowlege that the holie Eucharist, otherwise called the Supper of our Lord, is a Sacrament of the<note place="margin">What al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse.</note> new Testament, instituted by Christ, though it be now here in the holie Scripture called à Sacrament. Secondly, Catholiques doe beleue, and hold that in<note place="margin">What Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques beleue.</note> this holie Sacrament, bread and wine are transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated, that is, substantially changed into the very bodie and bloud of Christ, really and substantially present; but inuisibly vnder the visible accidents of bread &amp; wine. Thirdly, Lutherans say that the<note place="margin">What Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans hold.</note> very bodie and bloud of Christ are really, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially present, together with bread and wine, stil remayning in their natural substance.

Seing therfore it is certaine, that Christ could, if it was his wil, make his owne bodie and bloud really, &amp; substantially present, vnder the accidents of bread &amp; wine, &amp; it is an assured Maxime, cleare in euerie reasonable mans vnderstanding: That what soeuer Christ (yea or anie other man) both<note place="margin">What soeuer anie man can and wil doe, that thing he doth in deede.</note> can doe &amp; wil doe, he in deede doth the same thing: it is only to be discussed, whether Christ our Lord had an actual wil to doe it, or no? for of his power none but plaine Infidels make anie doubt.

Sacrament, to be eaten: And though manie murmuring said [This saying is hard,<note place="margin">v. 60 61.</note> and who can heare it?] he stil confirmed the same, and blamed the incredulous, saying to them [Doth this scandalize you?] plainly signifying, that they ought not to be scandalized. And further insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that after his Ascension, they would take more occasion of scandal, saying [If then you shal see the Sonne of man ascend, where he was before▪ [As if he saied, Seing you are scandalized with my doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, whyles I am present with you in earth, you wil be more scandalized, when I shal be ascended from

Neuertheles he told them, that the<note place="margin">The want of an humble true spirite is the cause of not beleuing Christ word.</note> lacke of humble spirite, &amp; their carnal conceipt, was the cause of their scandal, saying [It is the spirite<note place="margin">v. 63.</note> that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing] It is the humble spirite, illuminated &amp; moued by Gods special grace, that beleueth his word.

[No man can come to me, vnles<note place="margin">v. 44. v. 65.</note> the Father that sent me, draw him: vnles it be geuen him of my Father.] So certaine it is that no man of himself, by his owne sense, or natural reasen, can beleue this, or other high Mysteries, but by special grace, through which the humble spirite, beleueth and confesseth, al highest pointes of Christian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And this explication of our Sauiours wordes, is further confirmed, by his like speach afterward, saying to S. Peter [Blessed art thou Simon Bar-Iona;<note place="margin">Mat. 16. v. 17.</note> because flesh &amp; bloud hath not reuealed it to thee; but my Father, which is in heauen.] And by the like sentence of S.

Againe it were most absurde, yea horrible to heare, that Christs flesh profiteth nothing: for then his Incarnation, Passion, and Death, should profite nothing, which no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian dare to speake: except he be as wicked, and impudent, as the old condemned heretike Nestorius: and then we answer, that Christs flesh redemed vs, quickeneth vs, wil raise vs vp from death to glorie: because it is the flesh of God and Man, vnited to the eternal Word, the Sonne of God. For in deede the flesh of a mere man, could not quicken. And yet that heretike did confesse, that the flesh of Christ as man, is in the holie Eucharist, but not the flesh of God and Man: which heresie then trubled the Church, now the Zuinglians, and others. Al which notwithstanding it is cleare by the Euangelist S. Iohn, that [Christ promised to geue his flesh to be<note place="margin">v. 52. 55.</note> eaten; and that the same is meate in deede.]</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:178362:65"/> how our Lord and Sauiour instituted the holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Eucharist, and ordained his owne Testament. In the Syriake Edition, S. Matthew<note place="margin">The Syriake Edition plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testifieth the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que doctrine.</note> saith: This is the substance of my bodie. S.

Al which according to the very sacred letter, and expresse termes, doe testifie the Catholique beleefe, and doctrine, so manifestly, that our Aduersaries are forced to flee<note place="margin">Our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries flee from the expresse word of God, pretending impossibilitie, in the literal sense.</note> vnto diuers interpretations, and to frame manie answers, in excuse of their incredulitie: especially vsing two euasions. First they hold it to be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Wherunto we haue answered in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Nu. 3.</note> of this present Article, that al thinges are possible with God, who hath done, &amp; stil doth other workes, aboue the ordinarie course of al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Secondly they pretend our Lords speach, and wordes in this whole passage, to be like to his figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue speaches in other places, &amp; times, when he said: [I am the doore of the sheepe, I am the true<note place="margin">Ioan. 10. v. 7. Ch. 15. v. 1. 5.</note> vine: and my Father is the husbandman: I am the vine, you are the branches,] and such others. It is easyly, and firmely answered, that there is great disparitie in manie respectes. First in the wordes<note place="margin">Al testament require plaine and vsual ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</note> aboue rehearsed, Christ our Lord made his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and in euerie testament, plaine &amp; proper sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant termes are necessarily required. Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, Allegorical, and al obscure strange speaches are auoided [This is my bloud of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Mat. 26. v. 28. Luc. 22. v. 20.</note> (sayde our Lord) The new Testament in my bloud] Secondly Christ here instituted a Sacrament,<note place="margin">So doth the Institution of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as our Aduersaries acknowlege. And in that respect also, proper &amp; vsual termes are requisite. As were his wordes to his Apostles, concerning Baptisme. [Teach al nations, baptizing them in the name of<note place="margin">Mat. 28. v. 19.</note> the Father, &amp; of the Sonne, &amp; of the Holie Ghost] In the other places, where our Lord said, that [he is a doore, &amp; a vine] he neither instituted Testament,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:178362:66"/> nor Sacrament. Thirdly, when our Lord said [This is my bodie (which are most plaine wordes, though the thing expressed by these wordes, is an high My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie<note place="margin">Christ also declared that he gaue his very bodie &amp; bloud in the B.

Cor. 11. v. 24.</note> Sacramēt) which shal be deliuered for you] for both are true [is geuen] as S. Luke writeth, &amp; [which shal be deliuered] as S. Paul witnesseth. For euerie one doth not write al, which our Lord spake. In like maner he said: [This is my bloud, of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. v. 28.</note> which shal be shed. This chalice is the new Testament in my bloud] affirming as certaine, that his self same bodie, which was deliuered on the Crosse, his self same bloud, which was shed, was also in the B. Sacrament. But our Lord did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine his other speaches [I am a doore: I am the vine, you the branches] and the like Allegories, to shew that they were to be vnderstod, of an artificial doore, or natural vine of the vinneyeard. For they were in deede Allegorical speaches, and so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, &amp; applied to his meaning. And therfore these euasions of Protestants, can not excuse their incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, nor satisfie faithful Christians, which beleue and hold Christs wordes to be true, as he spake them in plainest termes.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Yet further it is proued by the testimonie of S.<note place="margin">S. Luke and S.

His wordes are thus [This is the chalice,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. v. 20.</note> the new Testament in my bloud, which (chalice) shal be shed for you] By which ordinarie maner of

Wherupon we forme this perfect Sylogisme: That<note place="margin">Otherwise he is conuinced by an euident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which was shed, for our redemption, is Christs bloud.

But vnles his bodie &amp; bloud, be there really present, they could not be particularly abused in this act, of receiuing vnworthily. The grosse abuse of anie holie thing, is sacrilege. So bying, &amp; selling of holie thinges, is simonie. Falsely or vnlawfully swearing is periurie; but the offenders in such actes, &amp; the like, are not said to be guiltie of the bodie, and bloud of our Lord.

                     <p n="2">2. Touching the first of these particular pointes:<note place="margin">By concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Christ is wholly, wheresoeuer anie part of him is.</note> albeit by vertue of the sacred wordes of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the former part, vnder the accidents of bread, onlie Christs bodie is present; &amp; in the other part, vnder the accidents of wine, is onlie Christs bloud: yet by concomitance of al thinges in Christ: (now glorified) where his bodie is, there also is his bloud, &amp; where his bloud, there his bodie, and where either of both, there also his soule, &amp; where al three, yea or anie of them (as in the time, betwixt his Death &amp; Resurrection) there also is his Diuinitie, because they are al vnited to his Diuine Person. And so in each of the accidents of bread, &amp; of wine, and in euerie least particle therof, Christ is wholly, in Bodie, Bloud, Soule, &amp; Godhead. A figure of this was foreshewed in Manna [of vvhich the children<note place="margin">It was so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in Manna.</note>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:178362:68"/> is the same spiritual fruite, in one part of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, of this holie Sacrament (which infinitely excelleth Manna) as in both partes: and the very same, in lesse forme, which is in the greater? In an<note place="margin">In the old Sacrifices, he that receiued anie part, was made partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant of the whole.</note> other place the same Apostle speaking of the old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices saith, that [They which eate the hostes, are<note place="margin">1.

The Apostle hereby signifying, that they which did only eate of the hostes, did as wel participate of the Sacrifice, as if they had also drunke of the liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And the reason is, because in spiritual thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the effect, &amp; fruite is the same in euerie part, as in the whole. Thus it was in the figure, much rather it is so in the thing prefigured.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Which is yet more cleare by our Sauiours doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine<note place="margin">Christ attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth the same effect to the receiuing of one part, of the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as of both parts.</note> in the Synagogue at Capharnaum. For in that his diuine discourse, he attributeth the same effect to one part of this B. Sacrament, as to both the partes. Sometimes saying [Vnles you eate the flesh of the<note place="margin">Ioan. 6. v. 53. 54.</note> Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shal not haue life in you. He that eateth my flesh, &amp; drinketh my bloud, hath life euerlasting, &amp; I wil raise him vp in the last day] sometime saying [This is the bread,<note place="margin">v. 50.</note> that descendeth from heauen, that if anie man eate of it, he dye not. I am the liuing bread, that came<note place="margin">v. 51.</note> downe from heauen: If anie man eate of this bread, he shal liue for euer: &amp; the bread which I wil geue, is my flesh, for the life of the world] Aagane [This<note place="margin">v. 58.</note> is the bread, that came downe from heauen. Not as your fathers did eate Manna &amp; died. He that eateth this bread, shal liue for euer.] Which self same effect could not be ascribed, to one part, of this holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which is the whole effect of both partes, except, the self same efficient cause (Christ geuing life) were as wholly in one part, as in both partes.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:178362:69"/> And that our Lord here speaketh not only of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing spiritually, but also of receiuing sacramentally, and spiritually together, is manifest: as wel by the mention here of Manna (to which he compareth, &amp; preferreth this holie Sacrament) as by the termes of <hi>eating &amp; drinking,</hi> with distinction of eating his bodie, &amp; drinking his bloud, which plainly sheweth that he speaketh of sacramental communicating, &amp; not only of spiritual.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Againe by S. Paules doctrine, this truth, that Christ is in each part, of the seueral accidents, of<note place="margin">The same ir proued by S.

Cor. 11. v. 27.</note> of our Lord vnworthily, he shal be guiltie of the bodie, and of the bloud of our Lord.] In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wordes touching the crime of an vnworthie communicant, the Apostle speaketh disiunctiuely [Whosoeuer shal eate or drinke vnworthily] in the other wordes, touching the guilt of sinne, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth coniunctiuely [he shal be guiltie of the bodie, and of the bloud of our Lord.] So that the fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in vnworthily receiuing, the one, or the other part, of the holie Sacrament, to witte in the forme of bread, or in the forme of wine, maketh the offender guiltie both of the bodie, &amp; of the bloud of our Lord. Which could not be said, vnles both the bodie, and the bloud, be in each of the kindes: wholly vnder the accidents of bread, and wholly vnder the accidents of wine. And consequently. Christ is whole in each part of this B. Sacrament, his sacred Bodie, Bloud, Soule, and Deitie. Which is not hard▪ for anie true faithful Christian to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that beleeueth Christs real presence, in this<note place="margin">Rom. 6. v. 9.</note> holie Sacrament: because Christ our Lord, being glorious, his bodie, bloud, &amp; soule, can not be anie more separated, one from an other. Likewise when our Lord was mortal, according to his manhood, &amp;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:178362:69"/> consecrated this same holie Sacrament, his bodie, bloud, and soule were in each forme, of bread, and of wine, and al stil vnited to his Godhead. From which nothing, that his Diuine Person once as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpted, euer was, or euer shal be separated. But in the time betwixt Christs Death &amp; Resurrection, his Godbead was with his bodie in the sepulchre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his bloud &amp; soule; with his bloud on the Crosse, and other places, without his bodie and soule; and<note place="margin">Though God be euerie where, yet Christs huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is not euerywhere.</note> with his soule in <hi>Lumbus Patrum,</hi> without his bodie and bloud.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:178362:70"/> kinde of the accidents, it is al one fruite, and effect, by receiuing one only kinde, and by receiuing both kindes. And if the Protestants would beleue, the truth of Christs real presence, they would neither stand, vpon his being wholly in euerie kinde of the accidents, nor vpon their imagined necessitie, that al must receiue both kindes. It being therfore proued, that Christ is both really, &amp; wholly in each kinde,<note place="margin">Art. 18. 19.</note> it is therby euident, that the communicants receiue whole Christ, and ful fruite of this Sacrament, by one kinde only, and so it is not necessarie, that they receiue both.

Wherfore concerning our present purpose, you see by the fact of our Sauiour, &amp; by the practise of the primatiue Church, that it is lawful to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister this holie Sacrament, in one kinde only. And<note place="margin">The B Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metime bene ministred in both kindes to al commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, but more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in one kinde only▪</note> that in the thing itself it is indifferent▪ whether it be receiued in one kinde only, or in both. And so the holie Church hath in subsequent ages, sometimes administred it, to al Christians in both kindes: but more generally in one kinde only, as wel to al secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, as also to Clergiemen, yea to Priestes, except him onlie, that celebrateth the same Diuine Mysterie. For otherwise there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen the Clergie &amp; Laitie in this behalfe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The reasons of which more general practise, &amp;<note place="margin">It is not only lawful but also more conuenient, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vnder one kinde only for diuers reasons.</note> of the Ecclesiastical Decree made therupon, are especially these (stil considering, in euerie reason of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:178362:71"/> more conuenience, that there is no necessitie of both kindes to al communicants, as is declared) First there is great danger of sometimes sheding the most sacred Bloud, by mishappes which might chance, in great troupes of people, in so manie chalices, or other vessels, as would be necessarie: with peril also in keeping the residue, after the communicants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> were scrued. Secondly, there would be dissicultie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in manie places, to prouide so much wine, as might serue great multitudes, frequently reparing to this most holie Sacrament. Thirdly some persons, either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of natural, or accidental infirmitie, doe not wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the taist, or streingth of wine; &amp; therfore it is not so conuenient, with danger of reluctatiō, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, or with corporal hurt of the communicants, without necessitie, to administer to al in both kindes. Fourtly it is most conuenient, that Christian people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> receiue this B. Sacrament in one kinde only, that they may more exactly be instructed, and know, that Christ our Lord, is wholly in each part, &amp; least par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the accidents; &amp; that therfore they reapethe same fruite, by receiuing vnder one kinde, as if they receiued vnder both. Fiftly, to require both kindes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is a foule signe of grosse errour, &amp; want of faith, not beleuing that Christ is in deede, wholly in each part, of the accidents of bread &amp; of wine, after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof. Which kind of ignorant incredulous<note place="margin">Exo. 16. v. 16. 18.</note> people, were aptly prefigured, by those that stroue togather more of Manna, then the ordained mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which was neither more, nor lesse, then suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note place="margin">Sap. 16. v. 20. Exo. 17. v. 2. 3. Nu. 11. v. 4 5. 6 31. Ps. 94. v. 8 9.</note> for euerie one. And as it was in quantitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent for euerie one, so also it was qualified, that to the wel disposed it serued for bread, flesh, drinke, &amp; what they desired. But manie through their volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous concupiscence murmured for want of water,<note place="margin">It is hardnes of hart and defect in faith that some doe require to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vnder both kindes.</note> and desired flesh. Of which murmurers the Royal Prophete speaking, exhorteth others [not to harden
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:178362:71"/> their hartes, as those did in the desert.] Euen so it is hardnes of hart, and defect in beleefe, that moueth anie to require participation of this Sacrament, in both kindes, hauing it wholly in one.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Finally to answer the cheefe obiection touching this controuersie: where our Sauiour commanded his Apostles, that they should al drinke of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated<note place="margin">Mat. 26. v. 27. Mar. 14. v. 23.</note>

And that it is not a general commandmēt to al men, appeareth further, by our Sauiours geuing this holie Sacrament in one kinde only, &amp; by practise of some primatiue Christians, as is already shewed in this Article. Neuertheles both kindes must generally be<note place="margin">Nu. 2.</note> consecrated together, to make the complete signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, &amp; commemoration of Christs death.

And therfore amongst En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Protestants, &amp; other Caluinistes: because there

For they did not only acknowlege themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues sinners, or in general, that they had manie wayes sinned, as Protestants doe in the beginning of their common prayer: but also confessed their sinnes, the Euangelist saying [They went forth to him; &amp; were<note place="margin">Mat. 3. v. 5. 6.</note> baptized of him, in Iordan, confessing their sinnes.] And so did penitents at Ephesus, as it appeareth, also before they were baptized: of whom S.

And as this obligation is iustly necessarie, so<note place="margin">Manie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why penitents confesse al their mortal sinnes.</note> is it also very profitable for diuers good respectes, as wel for right disposition in penitents, to receiue remission of their sinnes: as for terrour, to make them more warie in their actions, considering the bond of confession, if they offend againe mortally. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It diminisheth also some part of the due satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by how much it is made with more humilitie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and sorow for hauing offended Gods goodnes. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> finally it is meritorious of more glorie, in eternal life. So vnspekable is Christs prouidence in ioyning manie benefites together. Al such sinners therfore must (if they wil be saued) make vertue of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, wherinto they haue brought themselues. For seing they are fallen into mortal infirmitie, in their soules, if they wil liue againe spiritually, and so liue for euer, they must vse the necessarie desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned medicine, that is they must repayre to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Phisition, designed by Christ, who only can cure sinnes: and hath ordained this meanes and remedie, that for remission therof, the guiltie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must come to the spiritual court, doing there, that which to them perteineth. If they beleue Christs wordes before recited, saying to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles [whose sinnes you shal forgeue, they shal be<note place="margin">Ioa. 20. v. 23.</note> forgeuen them: and whose you shal reteyne, they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:178362:90"/> are reteyned] Much more, if they obserue also, and duly consider the rest of his wordes, and actions at the same time (as is likewise recited) it is cleare, that Christ made the Apostles his ministerial Iudges, to forgeue, or to reteyne sinnes. And it is no lesse cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,<note place="margin">This ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce continueth to the end of this world.</note> that our Sauiour, ordained this meanes: for<note place="margin">Mat. 28. v. 20.</note> remission of sinnes, for his faithful people, euen til the end of this world: and therfore gaue this iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial power to others: which should succede the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: &amp; to al those, whom they, &amp; their Successors should impert the same power, and iurisdiction, so farre as it should be enlarged or limitted.</p>
                     <p>3. And thus much being clearly shewed by the holie<note place="margin">And therfore who soeuer wil haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of mortal sinne, must by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession declare the same sinne to the spiritual Iudge.</note> Scripture, and being manifest, both by light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and by practise also of al nations, that al Iudges must first know the cause which they are to iudge,<note place="margin">Ps. 4. v. 7.</note> before they can rightly geue sentence (either absolue or punish) It is therfore most certaine that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent which desireth remission of his mortal sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, through Christs mercie, and redemption, must repayre to some Priest auctorised by Christs ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, for this purpose, a spiritual Iudge: and by plaine, and syncere confession of al his mortal sinnes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his conscience, so wel as he morally can, and is able.

Gods Grace is the principal cause, but the same excludeth not the secondarie, &amp; partial

                     <p>MOre in particular the holie Scriptures doe also instruct vs, that prayer, fasting, and almes, are three especial satisfactorie workes of penance. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes<note place="margin">True faith, and repentance presupposed, Prayer, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting &amp; Almes deedes are especial satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> presupposing faith, which is the first ground, then true repentance, which is syncere remorse of conscience, for the offence of God, for the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of sinne, defiling the soule, and for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and separation from God, which sinne iustly deserueth. And so from this faith and repentance procedeth the fruite of penal workes, done with right intention of the mind, special grace assisting, without which al mans workes, and sufferinges, are dead of themselues, and insufficient▪</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The first and cheefest of these three is Prayer, an act of the minde eleuated to God. Wherunto<note place="margin">By prayer man conuerseth with God.</note> when Fasting, or Almes are adioyned, they serue as winges, by which prayer more effectually ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into heauen. As the holie Angel Raphael testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, saying [Prayer is good with fasting and almes:<note place="margin">Tob. 12. v. 8.</note> rather then to lay vp treasures of gold.] And so deuout persons doe often conioyne them al three together, especially fasting and prayer. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Esdras by word and example directed the children of Israel, which were come from Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, to pray that, God would sette them, and their children in a right way of seruing him, and withal to fast at a special times; as himself hath recorded in his historie, saying [I proclamed a fast beside the<note place="margin">1. Esd. 8. v. 21.</note> riuer Ahaua, that we might be afflicted, before the Lord our God, and might desire of him a right way for vs, &amp; our children, &amp; al our fubstance. And we<note place="margin">v. 23.</note>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:178362:105"/> fasted, and besought our God hereby: and it fel out prosperously vnto vs.] Neither did they pray and fast, for Gods direction only (which was one good cause) but also for more satisfaction, for sinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to which they were also obliged. For albeit the Prophete said to God [Thou ô God hast deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Ch. 9. v. 13. 15.</note> vs from our iniquitie] yet he saith withal, [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, we are before thee in our sinne, which two speaches must needes be vnderstood with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction: that God had deliuered them from the guilt of sinne, but not from al the guilt of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Otherwise if you say, that they were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from sinne, and yet were in the same sinne, and that in the same respect, it is a slatte contradiction: from which al holie Scripture is most free [Esdras<note place="margin">Ch. 10. v. 1.</note> therfore thus praying, and beseching, and weeping, and lying before the Temple of God, there was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to him of Israel, an exceding great companie of men, and women, and children; and the people wept with much lamentation.] To prayer also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne al Sacrifices for sinne, and are more properly<note place="margin">2.

Because God immediatly forgeueth the guilt of sinne, when the sinner is truly penitent, and his prayers, &amp; other good workes folowing, are in way of satisfaction. Christ our Lord prescribed that al shal pray for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes. Which prayer is stil to be said of euerie one, also after that his sinnes are remitted, for remission of the punishment remaining vnsatisfied.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Fasting was directly instituted in the Law of Moyses, for satisfaction: and the feast in which it<note place="margin">The feast in which the Iewes did especially fast was called the feast of Expiation.</note> was specially prescrited, was called the Feast of expiatiō [Vpon the tenth day of the seuenth moneth<note place="margin">Leuit. 23. v. 27. 29. 32.

Al which fasting was only acceptable in those, which were truly penitent, whose sinnes vpon their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance, were remitted. And so fasting is most properly for satisfaction, and not only for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the sinne it selfe. Therfore the Prophetes Isaias, and Zacharias earnestly admonished such as<note place="margin">Fasting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance hath smal or noe fruicte.</note> persisted in sinne, that their fasting was not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before God, who by the same Prophetes, thus expostulateth with such hypochrites. [Is this such<note place="margin">Isa. 58. v. 5.</note> a fast, as I haue chosen, for a man by the day to afflict his soule? Is this it, to winde thy head about like a circle, and to spread sackcloth and ashes? Wilt thou cal this a fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord?]

The Prophete Daniel aduised King Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonosor, to vse this meanes for redeming of his sinnes, saying to him: [O King let me counsel<note place="margin">Dan. 4. v. 24.</note> thee: and redeme thou thy sinnes with almes, and thyne iniquities with the mercies of the poore: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God wil forgeue thee thyne offences.] At least such almes procureth diminution, or delay of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sinnes, which the Prophete here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, redeming of sinnes. For this King continued<note place="margin">v. 26.</note> twelue monethes after this, in prosperitie. Holie Tobias knew wel the inestimable valure of almes deedes, &amp; therfore wholly imployed himself therin [leauing his owne dinner, that he might burie the<note place="margin">Tob. 2. v. 3.

And we in deede iustly: for we receiue worthie of our doings; but this man (Christ our Redemer) hath done no euil] And the same penitent also humbly besought Christ our Sauiour, to releue his soule, after it should be departed, when our Lord himself should be in his heauenlie kingdom (for it appeareth that he thought when Christ should be in glorie, his owne soule, should neede releefe) praying thus to him: [Lord, remember me, when thou shalt come into<note place="margin">v. 42.</note> thy kingdom.] To which humble petition, our merciful Sauiour answering, graunted more then the penitent presumed to aske, saying vnto him: [Amen, I say to thee: this day thou shalt be with me<note place="margin">vv. 43.</note> in paradise.] A most plaine, and free relaxation, not only from al his sinnes, but also from punishment due for the same after death.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An other example is in the practise of S. Paul,<note place="margin">S.

For wheras the Apostle [in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:178362:111"/> of our Lord Iesus Christ.] In his other Epistle to the same people, hauing in the meane time vnderstood, that the sinner humbly proceded in doing his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned penance, vpon such information, and at the request of some, he graunted relaxation▪ from the rest of his penance: saying [Of much tribulation,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. v. 4.</note> and anguish of hart, I wrote to you by manie teares; not that you should be made sorie, but that you may know, what charitie I haue more abundantly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you] shewing that as wel in punishing, as pardoning, he had great charitie toward them, and so being now to release the penitent, whom he had formerly bond, touching him, he saith: [To him<note place="margin">v. 6. 7. ad 11.</note> that is such a one (in the case as you know) this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke sufficeth, that is geuen of manie: so that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise you should rather pardon, &amp; comfort him, lest perhaps such an one be swallowed vp▪ with ouer great sorow. For the which cause, I besech you, that you confirme charitie toward him. For therfore also haue I written, that I may know the experiment of you, whether in al thinges you be obedient. And whom you haue pardoned anie thing, I also. For my self also, that which I pardoned, if I pardoned anie thing, for you in the parson of Christ: that we be not circumuented of Satan, for we are not ignorant of his cogitations.] Thus the Apostle both bond, and loosed sinners. And by this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fact of pardoning, it may euidently be seene, that as some semed too seuere against the penitent, them the Apostle exhorted to compassion, &amp; to confirme<note place="margin">v. 7. 8.</note> their charitie towards him. Others entreated for his relaxation, vnto whose request he agreed. His<note place="margin">The Apostle auouched both his auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie, and iust cause.</note>

                     <p n="2">2. In the old Testament no Sacrifice, nor Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had the vertue to remitte sinnes, nor to geue grace, but only to signifie the same, as geuen by God, if the persons were rightly disposed to receiue it,<note place="margin">Sacraments of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did only signifie iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace.</note> yet was it then foresignified, that our Redemer, in his new Testament, would both merite such grace, and conferre it by Sacraments, as by external In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, instituted by him for this purpose. For

For as God alwayes most iust, and most propicious, specially admonished al to walke rightly before him, keeping his commandments, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he admonished them, that if they sinned, his wil is, that they be cleansed, but not without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and punishment, especially the relapsed. And to bring them to repentance, he often sent them afflictions, and so reducing them from their wicked sinnes, releued them, and receiued them into new grace. As is manifest in their written Law, and in the Prophetes writinges, and other Histories of that<note place="margin">God promised benefites to those that kept his Lawes, and threatned punishment to those that transgressed, with remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> people.

Contrariwise our Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, saying [But if you wil not heare me, nor<note place="margin">v. 14.</note> doe al my commandments, if you dispise my Lawes, and contemne my iudgements, that you doe not<note place="margin">v. 15.</note> those thinges, which are appointed by me, &amp; bring my couenant to nothing worth: I also wil doe these<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> thinges to you; I shal quickly visite you with pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and burning heate, which shal waist your eyes, and consume your liues: you shal sow your seede in vaine, which shal be deuoured of the enimies.

As it foloweth in the same place: [They and their Children shal be afflicted vntil they<note place="margin">v. 39. v. 40.</note> confesse their owne, and their ancesters iniquities, wherby they haue preuaricated against me, &amp; wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked contrary vnto me, I also therfore, wil walke<note place="margin">v. 41.</note> against them, and bring them into their enimies land, vntil their vncircuncised minde be ashamed: then shal they pray for their impieties.

And it sheweth that al sinnes, so long as the sinners are in this life, if they returne by true repentance, may be remitted, &amp; grace geuen them, by the ministerie of Gods seruants, first in Baptisme (which also, is alwayes ministered by an<note place="margin">Luc. 11. v. 26. 2.

In further declaration wherof, let vs also consider al the other wordes, before and after: by which other effectes, with the state of the person to be releeued, the Minister, the matter, and forme of this holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, are likewise declared.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:178362:121"/> nothing at al disproue this holie action, nor hinder it, from being a perfect Sacrament. For the Priest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing anie one part only, adioyning therwith the deprecatorie forme, with intentiō there to complete the Sacrament, it is in dede complete. And may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be so administered, in case of necessitte, when the sicke person is in the last extremitie, like to depart from this world, before the rest (which is otherwise required) can be performed. And therfore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only one part of the sicke bodie, or more partes be annoiled, here are sufficient matter, forme, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, promise of gracious effect, and al other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges requisite to a true, and perfect Sacrament.

                     <p>IN these wordes of the Apostle [The prayer of<note place="margin">Iac. 5. v. 15.</note> faith shal saue the sicke: and our Lord shal lift him vp: and if he be in sinnes, they shal be remitted<note place="margin">Three effectes of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: one common to al Christs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: the other two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this.</note> him] are conteyned three effectes of this holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, one proper, &amp; absolute; which is strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the soule, in the agonie of death. An other
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:178362:121"/> effect is common to this Sacrament, with al other Sacraments of Christ, which is remission of sinnes conditionally, if anie remained. The third effect is also proper to this Sacrament: which is restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of corporal health, but conditional, if the same be more expedient for the soule. Al which we shal here further explicate, and declare in order.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. First, by these wordes [Prayer of faith] no doubt the Apostle meaneth the same prayer, whereof he<note place="margin">The proper &amp; absolute effect is strenghning of the soule in the agonie of death,</note> spake immediatly before, to witte the Priestes prayer ioyned with the action of annoiling, &amp; so the word and external element, that is, the forme and matter, doe ioyntly worke special effect in the sicke person, either in his soul, eor bodie, or both, signified by those wordes [shal saue the sicke.] For as in other places of holie Scripture, so here [to be made whole, and<note place="margin">Mat. 9. v. 2. 6. 7. 22. Ch. 14. v. 36. Io. 7. v. 23.</note> safe] sometimes signifieth both spiritual, and bodilie health, for so it is our Sauiours maner [to cure men wholly] and especially the soule, which is the more principal part. And so the proper, &amp; peculiar effect of this Sacrament, is the strengthning of the soule, with special grace and comfort, as wel to beare more patiently, the bodilie paine, and pangues of death: as to resist, and withstand the tentations of the enimie, who then most busily assaulteth the sicke, with diuers suggestions, to driue them into damnable state, or to kepe them therein: as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into presumption of imagined securitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due repentance, &amp; without helpe of Sacraments: sometime into desperation, &amp; distresse of mind, with out hope of Gods mercie, by aggerating the horrour of their sinnes, &amp; terrifying them with Gods iustice. Our Lord therfore most iust, &amp; most merciful, hath ordained this special supplie of grace, in the time of most neede, besides other holie Sacraments: that as the spiritual combate is then most dangerous, so new helpe, &amp; succursse of more strength is afforded,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:178362:122"/> by our propicious Lord, and Sauiour, who [neuer<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. v. 13.</note> suffereth his seruants to be tempted aboue their strength, but geueth also fruite (or good issue) with tentation.]</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An other spiritual effect is expressed in these<note place="margin">An other effect is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, if anie remaine, and if the sicke person be attrite.</note> wordes [If he be in sinnes, they shal be remitted him] which is the common effect of al Christs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, that if they be worthily receiued, they remitte sinnes, geuing first grace of iustification, if the soule was not actually iust, but only disposed therto by attrition: and if the soule be iust, it is [yet<note place="margin">Apoc. 22. v. 11.</note> iustified more] by increase of grace. These wordes therfore (if there were no other proofe) doe clearly shew (as is noted before) and inuincibly confirme,<note place="margin">Article. 38.</note> that this is a true, and proper Sacrament. For that no other Ceremonie, nor Ecclesiastical Rite, nor external signes, doe remitte al kinde of actual sinne, but only true Sacraments. And therfore the Apostle speaking generally of al such sinnes, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by anie Christian after Baptisme (for to al such persons he writte his Epistle) he affirmeth plainly, that the vertue of this prayer, together with the annoiling, doth remitte sinnes, if anie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the sicke person so annoiled. By adding of which condition [if he be in sinnes] he sheweth that it is not the proper effect of this Sacrament, but that the penitent must seeke remission of his sinnes, by the Sacrament of confession: and so expresly he exhorteth in the next wordes, saying [Confesse<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> therfore your sinnes, one to an other, and pray one for an other, that you may be saued] So the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the sacred text most apparently signifieth. And if after confession, or by anie defect in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (against the penitents wil, being willing to confesse al, if they were knowen vnto him, and in his memorie) there remaine anie sinnes, they are al remitted by Extreme vnction, whether they be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:178362:122"/> mortal or venial: for here the Apostle speaketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely without restriction.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The third effect expressed by the Apostle in these<note place="margin">The third ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral health, conditionally if it be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the soule.</note> wordes [Our Lord shal lift him vp] is assuredly true,<note place="margin">v. 15.</note> no lesse then the other two: but only the first is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, without condition, and the other two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. For as the effect, of remission of sinnes, which is last expressed, is conditional, if he be in sinnes: so this which is expressed in the midde place, must nedes to be vnderstood, to be also conditional; in respect of corporal health, if the same be more expedient for health of the soule. Because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the lesse benefite should preiudice the greater,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. v. 4.</note> which can not be in Gods workes, for they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes perfect in themselues. And we see by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that albeit some are restored to corporal health, after this Sacrament, yet manie are not; Gods prouidence ordayning to euerie one of his seruants, that which is best for them, alwayes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">Luc: 11. v. 9. 10. 13.</note> and granting the deuout prayers of the iust, though not alwayes in that sense, as they demand, yet to such effect, as his diuine wisdom knoweth to be better. For as the same Apostle teacheth [some<note place="margin">Iac. 4. v. 3.</note>
                        <note place="margin">We must not pray for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral thinges, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if they be to Gods more honour, and health of soules.</note> aske, and receiue not, because they aske amisse.] And so if they should pray absolutely for corporal health, by vertue of this holie Sacrament, they should in that point pray amisse. Because we must neuer pray absolutely, for anie temporal or corporal thing, but conditionally, if it be (and so farre as it may be) to Gods more honour, and the good of soules. As re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes is alwayes most necessarie, where they remaine: for otherwise the soule is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of other grace. And therfore the forme of this deprecatorie Sacrament, is a direct prayer for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and remission of sinnes, which haue bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of the sicke person, by abuse of al, or anie of his senses. And so accordingly, as the worde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The first of these is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:178362:126"/> euident, which is Imposition of Apostolical, or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal handes, with wordes signifying the power geuen, and with deliuerie of some thing, wherin<note place="margin">External signe▪</note> the same power is to be practised. As to him that is made a Priest, are deliuered bread and wine, with power to consecrate them. To a Deacon is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Booke of the Gospels, with imposition of handes. And in other Orders other thinges. So the Apostles made the seuen Deacons, by imposition of<note place="margin">Act. 6. v. 6.</note> handes: and although in the same place, there is not mention of power to preach the Gospel, yet it is manifest, that S. Steuen, &amp; S. Philippe did preach,<note place="margin">Ch. 7. Ch. 8. v. 5.</note> and baptize, and the same is to be vnderstood of the rest, which presupposeth that they had commission so to doe. And S. paul and S. Barnabas were orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">Ch. 13. v. 3.</note> Bishopes, and Apostles, by imposition of handes. The second thing required is grace, to be geuen,<note place="margin">Collation of grace.</note> which S. Paul testifieth, was geuen to S. Timothee, when he receiued holie Orders, saying to him [Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect<note place="margin">1.

In saying [with imposition of handes of Priesthood] he plainly signifieth, that grace was geuen him, by that external signe of imposition of handes, that is by Ordination. Againe S.

Paules handes, ordaining S. Timothee a Priest,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:178362:127"/> and a Bishope? The third thing requisite in euerie<note place="margin">Priesthood was instituted by Christ.</note> Sacrament, is Diuine Institution, which is both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by Christs wordes, [saying to his Apostles<note place="margin">Luc 22. v. 19.</note> (after that he had consecrated the B Sacrament of his owne bodie and bloud) Doe ye this] therby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Priestes, and so instituting the holie order of Priesthood. And the same is also necessarily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, by the other two requisite conditions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no other man but onlie Christ, who is God &amp; Man, can annexe grace to an external signe. And therfore whensoeuer a visible external signe. hath grace adioyned vnto it, the same is a true Sacrament of Christ, instituted by him: whether his Institution therof be expressed or no.

Which figure is fulfilled in the thing prefigured, with special excellencie.

And the blessed say to Christ [Thou hast made vs to our God a Kingdom and Priestes.] Thus they finde in the written word of God, to serue their turne, if themselues may vnderstand, and applie it as they list. But if they wil consider the whole passage, and search the true sense, they may see, that the Apostles<note place="margin">Io. 5. v. 39.</note> and other blessed Sainctes, speake not of Priesthod, as it is properly taken: no more then of proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and of proper Kinges. For S. Peter saith, that al Christians ought to be such Priestes, as may offer spiritual hostes, not external proper Sacrifices. And consequently he speaketh of spiritual, vnproper Priesthod. Albeit therfore such spiritual Priesthod was in the Iewes, of al the tribes, and is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently in al good Christians: yet could not anie lawfully offer hostes, and immolate Sacrifice in the<note place="margin">Leuit. 21. v. 17. &amp;c.

And so whosoeuer imploy themselues, and their laboures, to the seruice of God, and offer al their actions, as spiritual hostes, an acceptable sacrifice to him, are spiritually Priestes. But as he, that denieth proper Kinglie power to be only in consecrated terrestrial Kinges, Quenes, &amp; other ordinarie supreme Princes, and maketh al men Kinges alike: so he that denieth proper Priestlie power, to be only in consecrated sacrificing Priestes, and accounteth al to be Priestes alike: erreth grosly, &amp; sediciously opposeth himself against especial power ordayned by God.</p>

In that he saith: they are taken from men, it is euident that Ecclesiastical Ministers, are of Mankinde, not of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical spirites; secondly that they are separated in state from other men: from the state wherin they were borne, and made of an other state, wherof they were not before. In saying; they are appointed for men, he plainly sheweth that the Clergie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for the benefite of al mankinde, themselues and others.

Lastly saying [that he may offer giftes, and Sacrifices for sinnes] he telleth the principal function of the whole Clergie, to be the oblation of Sacrifice.

Which consisteth in a Sacred Subordination of Superiour Prelates, and other inferiour Clergimen, called the Ecclesiastical Ierarchie: hauing one Supreme visible Head, which was S. Peter in his time, &amp; after him his Successors, as is shewed in the first Part. Vnder which one head<note place="margin">Artic. 35. 36.</note> are constituted certaine Patriarches, in distinct partes of the Christian world: next to them are Primates, or Archbishopes, in their seueral Prouinces; then Bishopes, in their proper Dioceses: and vnder them other Pastores, in particular Parishes. With other Clergimen assisting: as Chancelers, Deanes, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons: and other Priestes, Deacons, Subdeacons,<note place="margin">Ecclesiastical auctoritie consisteth in the power of holie Order. and of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> and the rest. Some designed onlie to the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holie Sacraments, and other Rites; or to assist the proper Ministers therof: others haue also Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, belonging to the Regiment of the Church.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:178362:146"/> be executed without Iurisdiction, euerie Clergiman<note place="margin">Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is equal in al that haue the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> can as fully performe the function of his owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Orders, as he that hath greatter Orders. So euerie Priest can as really consecrate, and offer the holie Sacrifice, as a Bishope, or Chefe Bishope. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Actes of Iurisdiction, the inferiour Pastor, as perfectly, performeth that which is within his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as the superior can doe it.

Other Pastors haue more, or lesse Iurisdiction, according to their limited circuites of places, or persons, or causes.

Because in that state of innocencie, by the vertue of Original Iustice, the soule had perfect dominion ouer the bodie, and the superior power of the soule, ouer the inferior.

Otherwise he would not haue made the Law of Mariage straiter, then it was before, but as this state is more perfect, so it is also a more easie yoke, by the helpe of Sacramental grace.

The occasion of speaking againe concerning diuorce, permitted by Moyses<note place="margin">The occasion of repeting the same was the Pharisees obiecting of Moyses Law against Christ doctrine.</note> Law, was the Pharisees temting him, and alleaging the Law against his doctrine, wherupon he auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. v. 4.</note> that albeit Moyses did permitte diuorce, for anie great dislike, or lothsomenes, for the hardnes of their hart, lest a greater euil (as the murder of the wife) should happen: yet there is in deede, but one onlie iust and Lawful cause, to separate man and wife, by perpetual diuorce, which is fornication: and as for marying an other, the first liuing, he said: that [he which marieth an other, doth committe<note place="margin">v. 9.</note> aduoutrie, &amp; he that shal marie her, that is dismissed, committeth admoutrie] which cleare wordes can not admitte former fornication, for an excuse of marying an other: because so to imagine, that after adultrie, it were lawful, to marie an other, yea for<note place="margin">The absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sheweth it to be false, and not agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Christs meaning.</note> the guiltie partie dismissed, to marie an other, is to make filthie sinne, an excuse, &amp; defence for fleshlie libertines, to sinne of purpose, that they may haue

The onlie euasion against this Apostolical doctrine.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:178362:157"/> is to say: The Apostle affirmeth not, that a woman once maried, &amp; liuing with an other man, her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer husband yet being aliue, is an aduoutresse, but shal be called an aduoutresse: as if S.

                     <p n="2">2.

And so by this power and auctoritie S.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:178362:161"/> his tentations, and wicked attempts. Not by anie maner of yelding to him, or by anie pact made with<note place="margin">It is a most wicked thing to intreate the diuel.</note> him: as Nigromancers, Sorcerers, Witches, &amp; other execrable miscreantes vse: but by diuine power, by the vertue of God, working by holie creatures, which are blessed by Gods Church, faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians may ouercome the diuels, expel them from<note place="margin">It is alwayes necessarie to resist him.</note> their persons, and places, auoide their malice, and procede in vertues, by vse of such sanctified crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Gods grace so strengthning his childrē, which cooperate with the same grace, not trusting to their<note place="margin">1.

Amongst which external meanes of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual helpes, next after holie Sacraments, as none is more frequent, so scarce anie other, is more potent, then Holie water.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An other principal Ritual Ceremonie, is the Consecration of Churches, &amp; Altars. Which is also<note place="margin">Consecration of Churches and Altares instituted by S.

Who<note place="margin">Anno Do. 306.</note> first instituted the solemne maner of erecting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Altars, annointed with sacred Oyle &amp; Chrisme, in publique Churches, representing Christ our Lord the Annointed of God: who is our Altar, Sacrifice, and Priest. For albeit euen from the Apostles time, special places were dedicated to God, and Diuine Seruice: of which some were called Oratories, others Churches, where Christian people mette to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to pray, to heare Gods word preached, and to receiue the B. Sacrament of the Eucharist, which<note place="margin">Act. 20. v. 7. 1. Cor. 16. v. 2.</note> S. Luke calleth [breaking of bread] &amp; where [col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections were made, the first day of the Sabbath] which is our Lords day: yet vntil Constantine the Great was conuerted to Christ (who first both by example, and publique decree inuited al Christians
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:178362:161"/> to build Churches) the Apostles, &amp; their Successors, with other Priestes and Christian people, resorted together secretely in priuate houses, and criptes, to auoide persecution, very often changing places. But when this holie Emperour was once conuerted to Christianitie, Churches, and Altares were erected, and solemnly consecrated, as now we see: and our Aduersaries denie not, though they seeke manie euasions to disalow the sacred dedication of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and especially they contemne, and destroy consecrated Altars. And therfore seeing the fact is cleare, it resteth only to proue that the same is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods word, and true religion, and in nowise, as they wil nedes contend, infected with anie super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. Which is manifestly shewed, by practise in the selected people of God, as wel in the Law of nature, as in the written Law of Moyses. For Noe<note place="margin">Gen. 8. v. 20.</note>
                        <note place="margin">Approued by the example of Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> immediatly after the floud erected an Altar to God, and vpon the same offered holocaustes to our Lord. Abrahā not only built manie Altars, but also bought a peculiar place for burial: where (it is probable)<note place="margin">Ch. 23. v. 9. 13.</note> he erected some house: and doubtles dedicated the same, to that and other Religious vses. Iacob also in his prayer, when he had seene Angels descending<note place="margin">Ch. 28. v. 16.</note> and ascending by a ladder, which reached from the earth to heauen, vowed to build, dedicate a house to God in the same place, &amp; afterwards performing his holie vow, called the place Bethel, that is, The<note place="margin">v. 19.

                     <p n="4">4. In the written Law nothing was more exactly commanded, amongst the ceremonial precepts, then<note place="margin">The making and erecting of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, was an especial figure of Temples, in the Church of Christ.</note> the building of the Tabernacle, with the thinges<note place="margin">Exod. 25. v. 10. 17. 18. 23. 31. &amp;c.

For accomplishing wherof, the deuoute people contributed so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that their voluntarie oblations did not only suffice, but being ouer much, publique proclamation was made, that they should offer no more. [The gold<note place="margin">Ch. 38. v. 24.</note> that was spent in the worke of the Sanctuarie, which vvas offered in donaries, vvas nine and tvventie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and seuen hundred thirtie sicles, according to the measure of the Sanctuarie.

Now it foloweth in this third Part to explicate in like sorte the Tenne Commandments of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:178362:166"/> God. And so in the fourt Part to declare the necessity, and efficacie of Prayer: according to the Methode proposed in the Preface. To procede therfore in this present subiect, as in the matters of Faith, and of the holy Sacraments; so likewise concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, our Aduersaries haue in these latter dayes raysed diuers Controuersies, though not so many in number, as in the former Partes: yet some of especial importance: which we shal discusle, as they occurre. And first touching al the Commandments in general, Protestants hold that it is vnpossible for any mortal<note place="margin">Protestants haue no good proofe, that the commād<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: or not necessarie, nor for only faith, nor for their special <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But that only Faith doth iustifie. Neither doe they meane the whole Faith, of al Christian Articles, but an especial assured perswasion of euery one, that whosoeuer beleeueth, that himself is reputed iust by CHRIST, and that he shal be saued, his soule shal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be in heauen, so sowne as it shal be parted from the body. None of which their Assertions can either be found, in expresse holy Scripture, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from thence: nor otherwise proued by any good ground, of sacred text or reason. But the direct contrarie Propositions are clearly proued, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed by many sacred textes, both of the old and new Testament. Vpon al which we ioyning issue of trial doe thus proceede.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God, who is alwaies the same, and whose iustice<note place="margin">Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, presuppose possibilitie to kepe them, both in the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fal of man.</note>

Which punishments had not bene iust, if either Adam in Paradise, could not haue obserued Gods precept; or Cain in the state of sinne, could not haue abstained from killing Abel.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:178362:166"/> Because by the rule of reason, none can be bond to a thing vnpossible. And where is no obligation, there is no transgression; and where no transgression, there can not be iust punishment. But Adam knowing by Gods commandment, that he was bond to kepe it: And Cain also knowing by the light of nature, that he ought to haue refrained from manslaughter: and consequently both Adam, and Cain knowing that their obligations were possible: were therfore iustly punished; and so neither Adam, nor Cain, replied to the contrarie, by pleading impossibilitie. For Adam in humble repentance, accepted the inioyned pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: and Cain despairing of mercy, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged his iust desert, saying to our Lord [Myne ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie<note place="margin">v. 13.</note> is greater, then that I may deserue pardon.] Further this possibilitie of obseruing Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,<note place="margin">Examples of fulfilling Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> is confirmed by examples of Adam in the rest of his life. For [he was finally saued] and of<note place="margin">Sap. 10. v. 2. Gen 5. v. 24. Heb. 11. v. 5. Gen. 6. v. 9. 22.</note> Enoch who [walked with God, &amp; was sene no more, because God tooke him. For before his translation he had testimonie, that he had pleased God] of Noe, who [was a iust and perfect man, in his generation, he did al thinges which God commanded him] concerning the making of an Arke, and preaching iustice by his life, and doctrine. [For I haue sene thee iust in my<note place="margin">ca. 7. v. 4.</note> sight] said our Lord vnto him. And S. Peter calleth him [the Preacher of iustice] Likewise by the example<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. v. 5.</note> of Abraham who [went forth of his countrie as our Lord had commanded him.] He walked before God and became so perfect, that vpon Gods cōmandment<note place="margin">Gen. 12. v. 4. ca 17. v. 1. Ca. 22. v. 2. 3. 4 &amp;c. v. 12. 16. 17.</note> he was ready, without reply, [to kil, and offer his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sonne Isaac in Sacrifice.] For which prompt obedience our Lord by his holie Angel gaue him te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, of iustice, and promise of reward saying [Now haue I knowne that thou fearest God: and hast not spared thyne only begotten sonne for my sake.

God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his whole people, when he had brought them forth of Aegypt, to kepe his precepts, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of protection, and other reward, if they would obey, and with threates of punishment, if they diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, saying: [If thou wilt heare the voice of the<note place="margin">Exo. 15. v. 26.</note> Lord thy God, and doe that is right before him, and obey his commandments, and kepe al his precepts, none of the maladies, that I laid vpon Aegypt, wil I bring vpon thee: for I am the Lord God thy Curer.] For so sowne as there was want of meate, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring: [Our Lord said to Moyses: Behold I wil<note place="margin">Ca. 16. v 3. 4. 5.</note> raine to you bread from heauen.

But the sixt day, let them prouide to<note place="margin">v. 26.</note> bring in (for the seuenth) and let it be duble, to that they were wont to gather euery day. Gather it six duies: but in the seuently day is the Sabbath of our<note place="margin">27.</note> Lord. Therfore it shal not be fond] which precept some obserued, and some transgressed: going forth on the Sabbath to gather Manna, but fond none. [And our Lord said to Moyses (and by him to the<note place="margin">28.</note> people) How long wil you not kepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:178362:167"/> and my Law?] Wherby it is manifest that some obseruing this commandment, it was not vnpossible: and some transgressing it, were bond to haue obserued it: els they had not bene iustly blamed. And the same is the nature, and condition of euery commandment of God, that al are bond, and al can, if they wil, through Gods grace, kepe it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Againe this doctrine as wel of possibilitie, as of<note place="margin">Gods threates and promises shew it to be both possible and necessarie to kepe his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> necessitie to kepe Gods commandments, is proued by the threates, and promises. As where our Lord immediatly after the first of the tenne command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, sayth [I am the Lord thy God, mightie, ielous<note place="margin">Ex 20. v. 5. 6.</note> visiting the iniquitie of the fathers, vpō the children, vpon the third, and fourth generation of them, that hate me: and doing mercy vpon thousands, to them, that loue me, and kepe my precepts.] To strike also more reuerence, and feare of God in this people; they heard [the voices, and saw the flames, and the sound<note place="margin">v. 18.</note> of the trumpet, and the mount smoking; and being frightod, and strooken with feare they stood a farre. of: saying to Moyses: Speake thou to vs, and we wil<note place="margin">19, 20.</note> heare: let not our Lord speake to vs, lest perhaps we dye. And Moyses said to the people: Feare not: for God came to proue you, and that his terrour might be in you, and you should not sinne.] Here Moyses saith plainly, that God sont this terrour, to make them afeard to sinne. Which necessarily proueth, that if they would, they could obserue the thinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: and that al this was done, to incline their willes to good, and to terrifie them from euil: leauing it in their power and wil, to doe the one, or the other. And therfore albeit manie did presently after these admonitions, fal most wickedly, making, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring golden calues, yet they did it voluntarily, not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily. As also manie other holie Scriptures doe abundantly declare.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For that none should pretend ignorance, or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:178362:168"/> God commanded his Couenant to be written.<note place="margin">God againe by commanding to write the same thinges often: &amp; often to read them, sheweth that they mist be kept.</note> Yea some thinges often repeted, and al to be often read. As when Moyses ascended the second time into the mount, and had receiued diuers precepts, Moral, Ceremonial, and Iudicial [Our Lord said to<note place="margin">Ex. 34 v. 27.</note> him: Write thee these wordes in which I haue made a Couenant, both with thee, and with Israel] Vpon an other occasion our Lord said againe [You shal<note place="margin">Leuit. 18. v. 4. 5.</note> doe my Iudgements, and shal obserue my Precepts: and shal walke in them. I the Lord your God. Kepe my Lawes, and Iudgements: which a man doing shal liue in them. I the Lord.] Againe he saith [Doe my<note place="margin">Ca. 25 v. 18.</note> precepts, and kepe my iudgements, and fulfil them, that you may dwel in the land, without any feare] In the repetition of the Law, Moyses againe and againe admonisheth, &amp; vrgeth the people to kepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Which were al in vaine, if it were vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. And if onlie Faith would suffice, he would haue vrged that cheefly, or only. But he stil crieth: [Now<note place="margin">Dent. 4. v. 1.</note> Israel heare the Precepts, and Iudgements, which I teach thee (and neuer sayth: that thou maist only know them, or only beleue them. No not in al the Law, neither in al the holie Bible: but he addeth [that doing them, thou maist liue. And entring in maist possesse the land, which the Lord the God of your fathers wil gene you.] Thus was a terrestrial reward promised to that people, in figure of heauenlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Gods spiritual children. But the one, and the other, to those that kepe his precepts. After recital of<note place="margin">The same againe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the maner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the Law.</note> special benefites, Moyses putteth them in minde in what maner the commandments were geuen, saying [You came to the foote of the mount, which burned<note place="margin">v 11.</note> euen vnto heauen: and there was in it darknes, and a cloud, and mist. And our Lord spake to you from<note place="margin">12. 13. &amp;c.</note> the middes of the fire. The voice of his wordes you heard, and forme you saw not at al. And he shewed you his couenant, which he commanded you to doe.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:178362:168"/> And the tenne wordes that he wrote in two tables of stone. And he commanded me at that time, that I should teach you the Ceremonies, and Iudgements, which you should doe in the land that you shal pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse. Kepe therfore yourselues carefully. You saw not any similitude, in the day that our Lord spake to you in Horeb from the middes of the fire: lest perhaps deceiued, you might make you a grauen similitude, or image of male or female: the similitude of al cattel that are vpon the earth; or of birdes, that flie vnder heauen, and of creeping beastes, that moue on the earth, or of fishes, or of the Sunne, Moone, Starres, &amp;c. and deceiued by errour you adore, and serue them.] These were the false imagined goddes, which some Iewes sometimes, and the heathen Paganes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally<note place="margin">Iewish, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical errours in Religion, are as detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Pagans false goddes.</note> adored for goddes.

And agreable to Christs former reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doctrine; the Apostle, in regard that the loue of our neighbour, presupposeth the loue of God aboue al; saith that [He which loueth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the Law] because the loue of our neigbour,<note place="margin">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:178362:186"/> would inferre, that the good workes of the faithful, namely the keping of Gods commandments, deserue not heauen, or anie reward at Gods hand. As if our Sauiour had said: that the keping of Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is vnprofitable, or doing al which we ought to doe, is vnprofitable. But he said not so. He teacheth, what true and humble conceipt euerie one ought to haue of himself, when he hath done that, which God commandeth him. That is, to ackowlege and say, that he is an vnprofitable seruant▪ towitte, vnprofitable to God. Neuertheles he is profitable to himself, &amp; shal receiue the wages of his master, due for his worke. Neither is his master bond to thanke him, but only to pay him his hyre, according to couenant. But the seruant is bond to thanke his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, for entertening him, imploying him, promising, and paying him his hyre; which he could not haue earned, except he had bene called, hyred, and sent to labour in the vineyard. And so God our heauēlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. v. 21.</note> and Master accounteth such a seruant [a good, and faithful seruant, and biddeth him enter into ioy, because he hath bene faithful: and by how nuch more the seruant humbleth himself, the more he is exalted.

The reason is, because in the Common, and Superior, the priuate, and inferior is conteyned, and hath his part (at least spiritually, for his temporal damage) and the Communitie, and Superior is not conteyned in the priuate, or inferior: except such as can profite the communitie, and so promote the common: for then such a one is reputed as publique.

But how these, their so charitable desires, were not against due order of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which they were bond to haue, in louing their neighbours as themselues, not before themselues, is no smal difficultie to decide.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:178362:201"/> Secondly some thinke that they meant only, that they were willing and content, to be for a time sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God, for part of satisfaction for others.

Speaking therein according to the assection of their mindes, not according to their iudgement of reason. Lastly it is also probably expounded, that they kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, by special reuelation, that themselues were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to eternal glorie, and so determined by God, that it should not be altered, they prayed instantly that seing God would not separate them, he would also extend his mercie vnto those others: the granting of which request, should be more gratful to them, then was their owne particular saluation.

Thirdly<note place="margin">Againe they calumniate Catholiques. And ignorātly contend, that to worshippe an idol, and to worshipe a Sainct for God are distinct kindes of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</note> the Protestants accusation is also false: in that they say: Catholiques cut of one of the tenne command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: because we adioyne the prohibition of making a grauen thing to be adored, in the same command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the former wordes [Thou shalt not haue strange goddes] Which the Protestants say, are two distinct commandments: vainly contending about the maner of diuiding al the commandments into tenne: which is no matter of faith, seing we agree vpon the<note place="margin">Exo. 34. v. 28.

But the prohibition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal consent to carnal concupiscence of the flesh, is really as distinct, from the prohibition of internal consent, to vnlawful concupiscence of wordlie goodes, as the external act of theft, is distinct from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:178362:209"/> the external act of adultrie.

Wheras it is certaine, that the Blessed Apostle in this fact, committed no fault at al. For whether he erred in the person, thinking the Angel to be Christ our Lord, and so honored him as God, with diuine honour, it was no idolatrie; being onlie an errour in fact, not in iudgement, and wil (as if one thinking some noble mā to be the King, should knele to him, as to the King; it were in dede no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because he had no cogitation, nor wil to make that subiect, his King) Or that S.

And therfore he that so sweareth a wicked, or false thing, [buildeth his sinne vpon Gods backe] Yea<note place="margin">Ps. 128. v. 3.</note> albeit he doth not sweare that the thing is true or iust, but only that he thinketh it so to be. Which is true, because in dede he so thinketh: yet his thought being erromous, it is a sinne, because it is in dede a false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or vncertaine: and it is a wicked oath, because he ought not so to thinke, much lesse to auouch it in word, least of also to sweare. For the greater asseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an errour (or of an vncertaine thing as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) not only aggrauateth the sinne, making it worse, but also by reason of the oath, changeth the sunne into a worse kinde.

Albeit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such an oath be not false, because he that swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in dede thinketh as he sweareth; nor properly rash, because he sweareth deliberatly: yet it is vniust, because it is an vniust asseueration. For example a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran, a Zuinglian, or Caluinist, sweating that he thinketh, that Sacraments doe not remitte sinnes, as

As S. Paul declareth to the Christian Colossians. Whom certaine false Apostles endeuoured

And so admonisheth al Christians, saying [Let no man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iudge you in meate, or in drinke, or in part of a festiual day, or of the New moone, or of Sabbaths: which are a shadow of thinges to come: but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is Christs] signifying that Christs law, excelleth the old Law, as a bodie excelleth the shadow thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now concerning the causes, by which the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">The causes of keeping the Sabbath.</note> wil better appeare, and especially by their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: the old Sabbath was instituted in memorie of the creation of al things, as it were in sixe dayes of trauel, and of rest in the seuenth day. As Moyses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth<note place="margin">Gen. 2. v. 1. 2 3.</note> the Historie. And afterwards denounceth the Law, saying [The heauens and earth were fully fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and al furniture of them. And God rested the seuenth day, and sanctifyed it, because in it he hath<note place="margin">Exod. 20. v. 10. ch 31. v. 16. 17.</note> ceased from al his worke. The seuenth day, is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God; thou shalt doe no worke in it (Againe he saith) Let the children of Israel kepe the Sabbath, and celebrate it, in their generations. It is an euerlasting Couenant, betwen me, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel; and a perpetual signe. For in sixe dayes the Lord made heauen and earth, and the sea, and al things that are in them, and rested the seuenth day: therfore the Lord blessed the seuenth day, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified it; because in it he ceased from al his worke.] This was the first reason, pertaining to al the seruants of God, from the beginning of the world. The second, perteining particularly to the people of Israel. Was in grateful memorie of their deliuerie from seruitude in Aegypt. Wherof Moyses saith to the same people<note place="margin">Deut. 5. v. 15.</note> [Remember that thou also didst serue in Aegypt: and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:178362:227"/> the Lord thy God, brought thee out from thence, in a strong hand, and stretched out arme. Therfore hath he commanded thee, that thou shouldest obserue the Sabbath. But the causes &amp; reasons of instituting our<note place="margin">The causes of instituting our Lords day.</note> Lords day, are farre greater. One is a perpetual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, of our happie Redemption, from seruitude of sinne, and of Christs glorious victorie ouer death,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. v. 5. 10.</note> which is perfected by his Resurrection, the first day of the weke. An other cause, is an assured signification of the general Resurrection of al mankinde, which<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. v. v 21. 22. 1 Pet 3. v. 18. 21.</note> shal be most glorious to the blessed, and elect: repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the day after the Sabbath; in respect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is the eight day; and neuertheles the first day.

                     <p>HItherunto we haue, according to our purpose, explicated the, Ten Commandments of God, with other Ceremonial and Iudicial precepts, by keping wherof, through Gods special grace, the faithful gaine the kingdome of heauen: &amp; by wilfully breaking anie of them, fal into the state of eternal damnation. It resteth here brefely to speake of other good workes not commanded, but counselled, which are therfore works of Supererogation. Betwen which<note place="margin">A careful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth to doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Lest he omitte that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie.</note> counsels and precepts, is so much difference, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen good and better: betwen lesse and more merite: and consequently lesse and more reward. Moreouer these workes of counsel doe helpe not only, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning more grace, and glorie: but also for the better performing of the commandments, which are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessarie. Because those which wil endeuour no more, then that wherto they are strsctly bond, are in great danger to transgresse sometime, that which is expresly commanded. And they which in deede haue iust care to fulfil Gods commandments, wil for more securitie (lest they be deficient) rather doe a litle more, then omitte that is necessare. And likewise wil rather abstaine voluntarily from some thing lawful, then not abstaine from al that is prohibited. And wheras Prorestants denie it to be possible, for anie man, though he be iust, to doe such workes of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerogation, they denie it, vpon the same false ground, as they denie it to be possible, to kepe anie at al of Gods commandments: confessing (if themselues say<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Artic.</hi> 1. §. 12.</note> true) that they transgresse al and euerie one of the commandments. They beleue not in God, they hope not in God, they loue not God: they serue false gods:

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seing it is cleare, that a faithful person, can and doth beleue in God, which he is bound to doe by Gods commandment: It is also possible, that he can geue a morsel more of bread to a poore man, then he is bound to doe, by anie comandment: which in such a case of free gift without special necessitie, is a worke of Supererogation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But forsomuch as our Aduersaries are extreme<note place="margin">Examples of good workes more then were commanded,</note> importune, in denying and often deriding this point of Christian doctrine; we shal here shew by abundant testimonies of holie Scriptures: that good workes of Supererogation, are not only possible, but also are pious in the sight of God, and spiritually profitable to the faithful that doe them. No doubt it was a worke of pietie, tending to brotherlie peace and concord,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. v. 8. 9.</note> amongst freindes, that [Abraham gaue free leaue &amp; power vnto his Nephew Lot to choose which part of land he would haue to possesse] to which free grant Abraham was not bond in equitie, but of mere libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, gaue the choyse to Lot. For by indifferent equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and rule of reason, Abraham might haue chosen rather then Lot. At least it had bene abundant, or ful iustice, that the landes had bene appropriated by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting lottes, which part each of them should haue and possesse. Iacob an other Patriarch, in a vow made to God, did not only promise, if God should prosper him, to serue him sincerely, and to pay tithes of his fruites to both which he was formerly bond by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Law: but also he promised [to builde and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate<note place="margin">ch. 28. v. 20.</note> particular house, to Gods special seruice] wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he was not bond before his vow. And so it was a worke of Supererogation: and it is also manifest that God accepted it, as an act of free deuotion, saying to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:178362:284"/> Iacob afterwardes [I wil be with thee, I am the God<note place="margin">ch. 32. v. 3.</note> of Bethel, where thou didst annoint the stone, and didst vow vnto me. Now therfore (because thou so didst) arise and goe out of this land (from Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia) returning into the land of thy natiuitie] into Chanaā. And so our Lord blessed and prospered him, &amp; his progenie more &amp; more. When the Tabernacle, with al the appertinances, was to be made in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert<note place="margin">Euo. 35. v. 20. ch. 36. v. 6. 7.</note> [The children of Israel most liberally contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only sufficient, but also more then was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Albeit the necessarie expenses were required, yet the superabundance was of Supererogation: and meritorious. Such a worke did the men of Iabes Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laad<note place="margin">1.

Reg. 2. v. 5. 6.</note> reward at Gods hand, saying to them [Blessed be you to our Lord, which haue done this mercie with your lord Saul, &amp; haue buried him. &amp; now our Lord certes wil tender you mercie and truth] God wil according<note place="margin">ch. 7. 5. 2. 3. &amp;c. 1. Par. 29. v. 3. 6. 3. Reg. 7. v. 8.</note> to his truth, reward good workes. The same King Dauid did a worke of Supererogation, as wel in that he desired to build a Temple to our Lord, as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding meanes to doe it, though he was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to performe it. And so did the Princes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more for that purpose And king Salomon in<note place="margin">2 Par. 34. v. 5. &amp;c.</note> accomplishing it, in more excellent maner, then they were bond by anie commandment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is manifest in the written Law, that vowes<note place="margin">Vowes freely made doe binde in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> (to witte, free promises to God of good thinges not commanded) are pious actes, and being made in due maner, doe binde in conscience, to the performance therof, as these holie Scriptures doe expresly testifie [The man that shal haue made a vow, and bond his<note place="margin">Leuit 27. v. 2. ad 30.</note> soule to God by estimation, he shal geue the price (that is, if he geue not the thing promised, he shal geue the value therof) If anie man make a vow to our Lord, or
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:178362:284"/> bind himself by an oath, he shal not make his word frustrate, but al that he promiseth, he shal fulfil. When<note place="margin">Num. 30. v. 3.</note> thou hast vowed a vow to our Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it; because our Lord thy God wil require it; and if thou delay, it shal be reputed to thee for sinne. If thou wilt not promise, thou shalt be<note place="margin">Deu. 23. v. v. 21.</note> without sinne (which clearly sheweth, that the Law speaketh of thinges not commended) But that which<note place="margin">v. 22.</note> is once gone out of thy lippes, thou shalt performe, &amp; shalt doe as thou hast promised to our Lord thy God,<note place="margin">23.</note> and hast spoken with thy proper wil, and thyne owne mouth.] In al which, the same diuine Law declareth, that promises made by such as are subiect to the wil of Superiours, are not perfect vowes, nor doe binde, vntil they be ratified and confirmed, either by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse consent, or by interpreted consent of silence, after that the Superiours know, what is promised, &amp; doe not gaine say it. As the promises of maides in<note place="margin">Num. 30. v. 4. 6 8. 12. 16.</note> their fathers houses, whiles they are in maidens age. Also of wiues in their husbandes time, and the like, may be frustrate by their superiors: which they could not be, if the promises were of thinges necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and commanded. And if the superiors know and consent, then they are perfect vowes, and bind the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors no lesse, yea rather more, then the parties that made the promises. And so to bind themselues, is a<note place="margin">v. 24.</note> plaine worke of Supererogation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Moreouer, that such vowes belonged not only<note place="margin">Vowes doe bind as moral precepts also in the Lawe of Christ.</note> to ceremonial Lawes of the old Testament, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants would interpret them, and so account al such vowing to be abrogated in the Law of Christ, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proued by other holie Scriptures.

And what Scriptures haue they for their warrant? for sooth say they: Salomon also teacheth that [It is much better not to vow, then after a vow,<note place="margin">v. 4.</note> not to performe the thinges promised].

Because the operation of the minde, whether it be vttered by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wordes, or remaine secrete in thought, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth more then sense can reach vnto.

And therfore it is not voice, nor sound of wordes by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but the wil, and cogitation, hartely desiring Gods honour, or other good thing, that approcheth to God.

And so amongst the<note place="margin">Pant. 39. Artic. 1. v. Pant 4. Artic. 1.</note> rest, prayer should not be necessarie at al. Which their opinion being elswhere confuted, &amp; they confessing that it is a good thing (though it were not necessarie) to pray, both priuatly &amp; in publique assemblies, haue raised an other cōtrouersie, that prayer must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be in a tongue, which the people doe vnderstand: and that otherwise they cannot haue anie fruite ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither of priuate nor publique prayer, wherin though there be no smal difference, yet in both they erre from the Catholique doctrine: as we shal here breefely declare.</p>
                     <p n="2">2, First therfore concerning priuate prayer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, to whom we pray, our Aduersaries wil easyly grant, that it importeth not in what tongue we<note place="margin">In respect of God it is not necessarie to pray in a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue.</note> pray, for he knoweth al tongues: Yea he knoweth, al secrete cogitations, and so needeth no information. He also knoweth what is needful for vs, before we aske, and therfore nedeth no instruction: and he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes readie to grant the best thinges, and therfore needeth not perswasion. But in respect of those that pray; it is doubtles better that they vnderstand the language, in which they pray. For by attending to the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:178362:306"/> signification of the wordes, they may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed what to aske, and their minde may also be more sturred vp, hartely to desire the same good thinges, which are expressed in the wordes. Yet is not<note place="margin">Al fruite of prayer is not lost for lacke of vnderdan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the wordes.</note> this helpe so necessarie, that otherwise their prayers are fruitles. For albeit they vnderstand not the words, yet ioyning their intention, with the intention of the Church, they may in general, desire whatsoeuer the same holie Church asketh, by those wordes, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is needful to themselues, and others, for whom<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> they pray: and may also eleuate their mindes to God, desiring either good thinges in particular, if so it be Gods wil, or in general Gods most glorie, and health of their owne, and others soules. And so (them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues being rightly disposed) their prayers are good and fruitful. As likewise those that haue knowlege<note place="margin">Neither for lacke of actual attention to those wordes which we doe vnderstand.</note> of the language, wherin they pray, and are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to the signification of the wordes, doe not therby lose al the fruite of their prayers, through euerie distraction &amp; euagation of minde: no though the minde through humane infirmitie, be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for a while, into idle, or vaine cogitations, so that they doe not willingly consent therunto, but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their distraction, recollect their minde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their actual attention, their prayer is good, and loseth not the merite by vnwilling distractions. Much lesse is it anie losse, but is greater fruite, if the minde be eleuated to other spiritual good cogitations: which<note place="margin">See Art. 10.</note> is the best attention, and may be had without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the wordes of vocal prayers. For this kind of attention, especially feedeth the soule spiritually, and hath reward of God. [Who regardeth the wil, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the wordes, and knoweth what is needful for vs (which we know not) and wil geue the same<note place="margin">Mat. 6 v. 7. 8.

For he saith [Thou in deede geuest thankes wel] So that in this discourse of the Apostle, is plainly proued, that praying, and geuing thankes in a strange tongue, are not fruitles, but fruitful, &amp; wel done. Howbeit S. Paul in that place, speaketh not purposely of Ordinarie prayers, nor thanksgeuing vsual in the whole Church, but of a particular spiritual exercise amongst the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians. Wherin some errors were cōmitted, which he here correcteth. As we shal further declare in the next Article. And as for priuate prayers, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique<note place="margin">Priuate prayer may be either in a sacred tongue, or in a vulgar.</note> doctrine; and practise is, to pray either in sacred tongue, though not vnderstood, especially in most vsual Prayers, as the Pater noster, Aue Maria.

Neither was the disorder a general fault of manie, nor concerning holie Scriptures in general, nor anie Hymnes, Psalmes, Canticles, or other partes therof, in what language they must be read or song: but only of extraordinarie giftes bestowed vpon a few, and by some of them abused.

That Protestants therfore wil applie this doctrine of S. Paul, against the Publique Diuine Seruice of the Church in the Latine tongue, in the Latine &amp; Weast Church; and in the Greke tongue, in the Greke and East Church, procedeth of grosse ignorance in some: and of mere malice in others: who can not but see how absurdly this holie Scripture is wrested, against publique, or ordinarie priuate prayer in Latine. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle here treateth not: but only by the way of example, sheweth that extraordinarie prayer, thankesgeuing, or praise to God, in a strange tongue, is good: for [the spirite prayeth.

And so notwithstanding this, and al other arguments of our Aduersaries, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, it is sufficiently Proued, that priuate prayers may be in anie language; and that publique prayer ought to be in a sacred tongue. It resteth to see what other thinges are required vnto fruitful prayer.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. That holie Moyses praying for the sinful people committed to his charge, did in such maner vrge his<note place="margin">Gods seruants conceiue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to moue themselues to confidence in God, though God himselfe, is immutable.</note> petition, as it were alleaging reasons, why God should grant his request, was not to moue God, who is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and of himself most merciful: but it was to sturre vp himself more and more, and to fortifie his owne faith and confidence in God: and also his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards God (seeking principally his honour) and toward the people, seeking their safetie in soules and bodies. His first reason to this purpose, was his consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods honour, by mitigating his iust furie, and conseruing his peculiar people, whom he had chosen, protected, and prospered thus farre, whom if he should now destroy, he should seme to ouerthrow his owne worke and to frustrate his owne wil, and good pleasure. And therfore he said [Why Lord is thy furie angrie? &amp;c.] His second plea was also grounded<note place="margin">v. 11.</note> vpon Gods honour, lest the wicked enimies round about, should calumniously say: that God could not,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:178362:318"/> or would not conserue his owne people, nor aduance them as he had purposed. Wherupon Moyses said [let<note place="margin">v 12. v. 13.</note> not the Aegyptians say, I besech thee, &amp;c.] Thirdly he proposed the sanctitie of the Patriarches their next progenitours, to whom God for reward of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, had promised prosperitie to their seede. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he said [Lord remember Abraham Isaac, &amp; Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael thy seruants, &amp;c.] Fourthly wheras God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Moyses to preferre, and aduance him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, ouer a greater nation then this: he for his great charitie towards them, being his proper charge, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rather to be punished himself in stead of them, then that they should be destroyed, and he otherwise promoted, and so prayed God, saying [Either forgene<note place="margin">v 31. 32.</note> rhem this trespasse, or strike me out of the booke, which thou hast written, &amp;c.] As if he should say. Separate not them and me asunder, but either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, &amp; saue them with me; or punish me with them. By this worthie example, among manie others, true Christians are alwayes moued with al confidence to pray for the whole Church of Christ, his inheritance,<note place="margin">Act. 20. v.</note>

For so both quicke and dead participate<note place="margin">Ps. 118. v. 63.</note> of each others good workes.

That Priuate prayer may be in anie language; Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique must be in a sacred tongue. Also what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are requisite; with the Effect: and for whom we are bond to pray. Now it is further to be declared, to whom we must pray: and what we must aske. And first it is cleare, that al religious prayers are made to God [from whom only al good thinges procede] But<note place="margin">Iac. 1▪ v. 17.</note> for somuch as some doe imagine, that supplicants must alwayes pray immediatly to God, and that it is not lawful to pray by mediation of others, we shal in due place, shew that the Catholique doctrine, &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of praying to God by intercession, as wel of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious<note place="margin">Art. 41. 46.</note> Sainctes in heauen; as of other faithful seruants of God in earth, is both lawful and profitable. In the meane time concerning good thinges to be asked, and the maner, how to aske them, the most common forme of praying, called Our Lords Prayer, (The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster) is here especially explicated: as that which<note place="margin">The Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster excelleth al other Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in Auctoritie, Perfection,</note> excelleth al other set formes of praying in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:178362:326"/> of Auctoritie, Perfection, Vtilitie, Necessitie, Breuitie, and Order. For the Auctor is Iesus Christ; The Eternal Wisdom of God. Who hath made it so Perfect, that it conteyneth al thinges needful to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It is a most Profitable prayer, because it is most<note place="margin">Vtilitie,</note> gratful to God, as being composed by his onlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne: &amp; because in it we not only speake to Almightie God in the name of Christ, his Sonne our Lord (as in al other prayers) but also in his very<note place="margin">Necessitie,</note> wordes. It is also most Necessarie of al prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is expresly ordained, and commanded by the same our Lord &amp; Sauiour. The Breuitie is admirable,<note place="margin">Breuitie,</note> for in very few wordes, we aske al thinges that may be rightly desired: and we may very easyly lerne it, &amp; with facilitie often recite it. Finally, it is diuinely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed in most conuenient Order: directing vs first to<note place="margin">and Order.</note> aske our heauenlie Father, that which perteyneth to his owne most honour: secondly al spiritual thinges belonging to our selues, and al the elect in future glorie: then spiritual good thinges in earth.

For he is Immense, and can not be conteyned in place, nor in time, but he conteyneth and excedeth al places, al times, and al other thinges. He is incomprehensible, eternal, and is euerywhere, according to his Power, Presence, and Essence, infinitely more powerable then anie King in his Kingdome: more present, then the Sunne at clearest noone day: more essential then the Soule in a liuing man. But why then is God said to be in heauen, rather then els where? We answere: Because God in heauen, as in his splendent court, sheweth his glorie to the blessed Angels, and other Saintes, in whom he visibly reigneth: and by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of himselfe, maketh them glorious.</p>

The beginning of good life, is to depart from<note place="margin">It is a happie thing to rise from sinne, more happie to rise quickly most happie not to sinne.</note> euil. It is a happie thing and a special grace of God that some great sinners doe not finally persist in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life, but repent before their death: it is more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, not to continue long in anie sinne, but quickly to repent and turne to God: it is the greatest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of al, neuer to cōsent vnto euil suggestions.

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:178362:357"/> he gaue consent, and yelded to sinne: yet stayed not therin, but leauing that state returned to grace. And lastly he is also happie but in the lowest degree, [that hath not sitte in the chayre of pestilence] not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually remained, and died in damnable state. As this last is most dangerous, for what thanke is it to leaue sinne, when a man can sinne no longer in this world? so it is best and most secure not to yelde to any sinne nor euil suggestion, for to him is assuredly promised eternal glorie.

And therfore, neither the great distance of place, not lacke of corporal eares in holie Angels, and other Sainctes, can hinder the hearing of faithful prayers, directed to God by mediation of his glorious Sainctes: as the Protestants either foolishly imagine, or maliciously feane: and so deceiue themselues, or others.

Neuertheles he can, if he wil, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the same secretes of his hart, either by wordes, or other signes, to an other mortal man: or els by voluntarie cogitation, to such spiritual creatures, as haue spiritual eares. And so these wordes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete proue no more, but that naturally, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily euerie man can, if he wil, hide the secrete cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his hart: but they proue not, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,<note place="margin">Sainctes can know secretes by reuelation.</note> if he wil, reueale the secrets if his hart.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:178362:367"/> and can desire to reueale their secrete thoughtes to Sainctes in heauen: which desire and wil ascendeth into heauen.

To pray the glorious Sainctes, to pray for vs to God, is no more derogation to Christ, then to request our mortal neighbour, to pray for vs. For both in the one &amp; the other, we vse an other mediator to Christ.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:178362:392"/> But so to request the prayer of a mortal person, is lawful, and without any derogation to Christ. For it is euident, that the faithful haue in al times of the old and new Testament, prayed one for an other, which God hath both approued, &amp; sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: &amp; most Protestants allow, &amp; in their maner practise it. Ergo to request glorious Sainctes to pray for vs to God, is no derogation to Christ. In stead of answering to this demonstration, our Aduersaries commonly flee from the point, which before they vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, touching their imagined derogatiō from Christ, by praying to Sainctes: and rather stand vpon their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obiections, That Sainctes can not heare vs: Can not helpe vs, &amp;c.

But when they are demanded; Why<note place="margin">

They can yeelde no reason at al of difference. And we clearly shew, that neither the one, nor the other is anie derogation, but both are lawful. For the Catholique faith, and doctrine is, that the B.

            <p>IT shal not be necessarie to collect an Alphabetical table, of the particular pointes proued, and explaned in this worke: because the same, as in a Synopsis (or conspicuous Summarie) are prefixed in the beginning, according to the Methode of Christian Doctrine distributed into foure Parts: and euerie part into special Articles. in al two hundred. Because also euerie Article is distinguished into Paragraphes: and in the margine is noted the summe of the matter, therin conteyned. The very same wherof the other table should consist: which therfore in this respect semeth needles.</p>
            <p>Some faultes are escaped in printing: but such (especially in the two last Parts) as the Iudicious Reader wil easyly discerne, and correct. For example in the page 179. line 9. you wil read: <hi>Iniustice committed</hi> &amp;c. And vse the like corrections, where you finde other errors.</p>
